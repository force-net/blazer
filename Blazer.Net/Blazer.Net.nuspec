    <description>
    Blazer is high-performance, low compression archiver.
    Main usage to work with streams, but can be used as general archiver or for reducing application size by compressing it resources.
    Compression rate is comparable (slightly better) to LZ4 and Snappy and compression speed is really faster than GZip.
	Blazer contains all standard features for archives, but also it is possible to use control commands in stream, encrypt archive, use it as simple (but fast) crc32c calulator, perform patterned compresstion and many others features.

	See project site for detailed information.
